This is the repository for *Museum Catalogues in the Digital Age: A Final Report on the Getty Foundation’s Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative*, published February 2017 by the Getty Foundation, Los Angeles. This free online edition and a downloadable PDF are available at [www.getty.edu/foundation/osci-report](http://www.getty.edu/foundation/osci-report).

The book was created with Getty Publications’ [middleman book template](https://github.com/gettypubs/middleman-book-template), which has been used for other digital publications, including catalogues of [ancient terracottas](https://github.com/gettypubs/terracottas) and [roman mosaics](https://github.com/gettypubs/romanmosaics) in the J. Paul Getty Museum. The template was a prototype for an open source package currently under development by the Getty, which will be made available for use by other museums and publishers. Information about the Getty’s digital publishing efforts can be found at [www.getty.edu/publications/digital](http://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/index.html).

## About the Book

Publishing scholarly collection catalogues is a critical part of a museum’s mission. Based on meticulous research, these catalogues make available detailed information about the individual works in a museum’s collection, ensuring the contents a place in art history. Yet printed volumes are costly to produce and difficult to update regularly; their potential content often exceeds allotted space. Digital publishing presents an alternative, and the Getty Foundation’s Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI) helped museums make the transition from printed volumes to multimedia, web-based publications freely available to anyone with a computer, tablet, or smartphone. The Foundation launched OSCI in 2009 in partnership with the J. Paul Getty Museum and eight other institutions: the Art Institute of Chicago; the Arthur M. Sackler and Freer Gallery of Art; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Seattle Art Museum; Tate; and the Walker Art Center. This is the final report of the intiative.
