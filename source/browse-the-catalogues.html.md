### Art Institute of Chicago

#### [Monet: Paintings and Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.artic.edu/collections/books/online-scholarly-catalogues)

- 47 Artworks by Monet
- Zoomable images
- Convservation image overlays
- Automatic citation tool
- AAM Bronze MUSE Award, Interactive Kiosks (2014) for “Renoir’s True Colors”, utilizing OSCI catalogue components
{:.features}

The Art Institute of Chicago’s first two online catalogues, *Monet: Paintings and Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago* and *Renoir: Paintings and Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago*, featuring forty-seven artworks by Monet and twenty-five by Renoir, were released in summer 2014. Entries about each artwork were designed to be as comprehensive as possible, with each including new art-historical research and unprecedented high-resolution imaging that allows readers to zoom in to see the artist’s brushstrokes, and previously unpublished technical photography (such as X-ray, infrared, and other imaging), which unveils information hidden beneath the surface of the work using interactive, layered images. Conservation reports on each artwork offer in-depth studies of the artists’ process and incorporate new scientific data on their materials. Other features include a glossary, an automatic citation tool, scanned archival materials, and biographical information about significant historical collectors for the museum. The catalogues were peer-reviewed and they are editioned, not updated, on a regular basis.

For this project, the team contracted with the IMA Lab to create a prototype authoring environment, the ChicagoCodeX (CCX), built in the open-source content management system Drupal; the CCX became the basis for the OSCI Toolkit. The Art Institute published both volumes on the fully implemented CCX. The museum uses a custom-built CMS called Collection Images Text and Index (CITI), which includes a basic digital asset system (DAMS), and a CITI-driven clone for its website. There is currently no connection between CITI and OSCI, but there has been development within CITI with the goal of making it possible to publish metadata and tombstone information from CITI directly to the OSCI platform in the future. The Art Institute is in the beginning of a multiyear implementation of a DAMS project using Fedora. CITI will be used as an authoring environment for all assets, including the ones related to OSCI, and these assets will be stored in the DAMS. Future OSCI catalogues will be able to retrieve assets and metadata directly from the DAMS.

### Freer and Sackler Galleries

#### [The World of the Japanese Illustrated Book](http://pulverer.si.edu/)

- 46 books of artist and printmaker, Katsushika Hokusa
- Video interviews
- Fully searchable database
- User log in for notetaking
- Bronze “Telly” Award (2015) for the Ukiyo-e technique video
{:.features}

In 2007 the Freer and Sackler Galleries acquired the Gerhard Pulverer Collection, a private collection of premodern Japanese illustrated books numbering about 900 titles in 2,200 volumes, which includes approximately 70,000 images. The goal of the Freer/Sackler OSCI project is to provide a model for museums with large collections of manuscripts and rare books. To make the project more manageable, the Freer/Sackler team decided to focus its efforts on a smaller subset of the holdings and produce a microsite fully realizing the material in forty-six books representing the work of Edo period artist and printmaker, Katsushika Hokusai. This catalogue was published in June 2014. The essays in the catalogue have been peer-reviewed.

Working with the IMA Lab and using components of the OSCI Toolkit in a custom-built website, the team has created the first phase of a catalogue that will eventually include the entire Pulverer Collection. The initial version of the site was designed to prototype all of the components of the full site: scholarly essays and video interviews about aspects of the collection, a fully searchable database of the titles with complete cataloguing according to accepted protocols for Japanese book catalogues, and a password-protected area of the site where researchers can save searches, annotate text on the site, and make their own research notes. The site draws cataloguing data from the museum’s TMS database, images from the Smithsonian’s DAMS, and uses the museum’s own CMS to manage the site. The content of Freer/Sackler’s catalogue is dynamic and updated on a regular basis. (ASK NANCY: F/S’s CMS or Smithsonian’s)

### Los Angeles County Museum of Art

#### [Southeast Asian Art at LACMA](http://seasian.catalog.lacma.org/)

- 34 highlights from the museum’s collection
- 360-degree image rotation for select objects
- Chapter-level PDF downloads
- Automatic citation tool
{:.features}

LACMA launched its online scholarly catalogue dedicated to the museums’s collection of Southeast Asian art in October 2013. The publication focuses on thirty-four highlights from the museum’s collection, complemented by numerous comparative images and including extended essays on topics such as light symbolism, female deities, and the impact of Buddhism on Sri Lankan and Southeast Asian art. Southeast Asian art is the first in a series of online scholarly catalogues designed to provide an in-depth, Web-based reading experience enhanced with unique media features such as videos, 360-degree image rotation for select objects, and an easy online citation tool.

LACMA’s publication is a stand-alone website, which is not dynamically connected to its collections or DAM databases. It is editioned, not updated continuously. As knowledge of the collection evolves over time, the museum will issue future editions of the website under a unique URL. LACMA utilized the OSCI toolkit developed by IMA Labs in the development of the website, but created new features and customized the appearance of the Toolkit to support the catalogue’s unique design. LACMA added features that increase interactivity and allow embedding of various types of multimedia content, such as the 360-degree image rotator, which was contributed back to the open-source OSCI Toolkit.

{:.features}

The NGA has a long history of producing peer-reviewed “systematic catalogues” on its permanent collections. For the OSCI project, its team thoroughly updated and enlarged Arthur K. Wheelock’s out-of-print catalogue documenting the gallery’s seventeenth-century Dutch paintings, outfitted it with tools for students and scholars—and with overviews and curator-led video tours for broader audiences—and integrated this rich content within the gallery’s public website. The tools allow for a customized reading experience and include preformatted citations, sophisticated image comparison capabilities, PDF print and download options, archived editions, and permanent URLs. The catalogue was published in April 2014 and is editioned, not dynamically updated, although it will be reviewed and refreshed on a five-year cycle. Bringing this enhanced systematic catalogue online has changed the course of the entire series of museum permanent collection catalogues from print to digital and led to the renaming of the series (seventeen previously published and about fifteen new collection volumes). NGA Online Editions is intended as a model for institutions wishing to give prominence to authoritative, peer-reviewed scholarship and engaging media in their online presentation of collection information.

The technology plan for the project involves the use of the website’s existing CMS (Adobe Experience Manager, formerly called CQ5) to store long text files as well as to retrieve collection data from TMS and digital images from Extensis Portfolio. The needs of the OSCI project were addressed in the context of the institution’s overall Web and digital strategy.

{:.features}

*The Rauschenberg Research Project* was launched by SFMOMA in July 2013, with eighty-seven artworks by twentieth-century American artist Robert Rauschenberg. The catalogue incorporates a variety of layered, media-rich content, including essays, numerous images, and video interviews with the artist, as well as archival and conservation documentation. All catalogue content is fully integrated into the Collections section of the museum’s website. Rauschenberg works appear alongside other works in the online collection, but are augmented with the substantial resources produced for this publication. Since launching the project, SFMOMA has added one newly acquired artwork, *Rosalie/Red Cheek/Temporary Letter/Stock* (1971). In conjunction with this addition, the OSCI team included new bibliographic and exhibition citations culled since launch as part of a planned annual review and update.

SFMOMA uses Gallery Systems’ EmbARK software for cataloguing and managing its collections. At the time of launch, the museum’s DAMS was Autonomy Virage’s MediaBin, which was synchronized with EmbARK for core collection metadata. Text and images were assembled and pages built in a custom Web CMS.

Independent consultants Frankly, Green ~+~ Webb conducted postlaunch evaluations of the Rauschenberg Research Project, including quantitative data analysis and qualitative audience interviews assessing the site’s findability, usability, and perception. The overall response was extremely positive, although it also highlighted areas for improvement. Changes went live with the annual update. The catalogue will continue to evolve as new works are acquired and areas such as exhibition histories are supplemented. The sustainability and portability of the Rauschenberg Research Project was confirmed during a global website redesign in late 2015. (JOAN REVIEW THIS)

{:.features}

SAM’s OSCI project focused on a core of approximately 130 works from the permanent collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy, many of which were recently acquired and not yet published. The catalogue launched in October 2013. A significant goal for SAM’s team was to develop a model for how technology can best be utilized to allow for viewing scrolls online. During the planning phase, the scope of the project increased to include commissioning scholarly essays from outside contributors and creating a means to obtain user-generated scholarly content related to the seals and inscriptions found on the artworks, beyond the work done by SAM staff and its contracted scholars.

SAM uses TMS for collections management, including the media module for managing its digital assets. As a medium-size museum, SAM has little internal or external information technology support. The intent of its team was to enhance the online authoring and publishing process around TMS, creating add-ins within the existing system. Museum staff worked closely with their TMS vendor, Gallery Systems, to design a software component that would add desired functionalities and use the company’s e-Museum framework to publish content online. The SAM catalogue is synced with TMS and is updated as information in the CMS is updated.

{:.features}

In creating its first online catalogue of the work of the Camden Town Group, which launched in May 2012, Tate developed a number of custom-built systems, integrating them with the existing online collection publication architecture. These include a cataloguing system, a collection research asset manager (CRAM), and two new data loaders to update existing systems within the collection publication architecture.

The cataloguing system encompasses a parsing application used to process research content, identifying and tagging data within catalogue entries, essays, and other texts. The parsing process creates an XML version of a text, which is used for publishing online and for updating TMS with new and changed data. The system also includes a hierarchy tool, used for building the structure of a research project and creating relationships with assets used within the project.

The CRAM is used to ingest and manage assets used within a research project—images (Tate collection and externally sourced), audio, video, and the textual content from the cataloguing system. The CRAM is integrated with iBase Manager (Image Management system) and Brightcove (Tate's Content Delivery Network) to enable ingest of official collection images used as reference images within the project, and audio and video content respectively. CRAM asset IDs are added to texts to reference-related assets prior to parsing. The CRAM is integrated with CIS, Tate's collection information service used to publish its online collection and all related content including that from research projects.

{:.features}

The Walker Art Center’s Living Collections Catalogue was conceived as a series of thematic volumes selected to foreground the Walker’s multidisciplinary collecting strategies. In keeping with the Walker’s interest in crossing disciplinary boundaries, the first volume developed during the planning phase was devoted to *performativity*, a term that lends itself to analysis and debate across artistic practices. This first volume launched in June 2014. Beginning with the second volume, the Walker modified the conceptual and administrative framework for its project to align with exhibitions and presentations from its collections and archives. *Art Expanded, 1958–1978* explores themes in the exhibition of the same title. Plans for upcoming volumes include the Merce Cunningham Dance Company Collection.

The Living Collections Catalogue design adopts a visual aesthetic for navigation and page layouts that blends the best qualities of the book, magazine, and online forms. Essays and archival nodes within a volume are editioned, while links out to the collections database provide artwork details that are updated dynamically. The project deepens and expands the online publishing platform built for the Walker’s website as a whole, including an authoring tool with sufficient options to handle a variety of text and media compositions.
