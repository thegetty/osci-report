### [Renoir: Paintings and Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago](https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings)

The Art Institute of Chicago’s OSCI publications focus on the museum's renowned collection of Impressionist masterpieces by Claude Monet (1840–1926) and Auguste Renoir (1841–1919). Organized as two separate catalogues, the volumes foreground conservation documentation using innovative functionality such as sliding, interactive image filters that reveal new research on how the artists changed their compositions over time. Another key feature is a customized citation tool for researchers to encourage scholarly use of the catalogues.

### [The World of the Japanese Illustrated Book](http://pulverer.si.edu/)

The Freer/Sackler catalogue builds on the recently acquired Gerhard Pulverer Collection of Japanese illustrated books, one of the most important collections of these distinctive hand-made works of art. The publication focuses on artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), whose unique style had a marked influence on European and American modern artists. The catalogue’s special features include a “digital study room” that allows readers to save their annotations, notes, searches, and favorites in their own password protected part of the site. Users can search the catalogue contents in either Roman or Kanji script, and a clickable timeline lets readers see at a glance how many books in the collection were published in any given year.

### [Southeast Asian Art at LACMA](http://seasian.catalog.lacma.org/)

Detailed object entries and new interpretive essays form the centerpiece of LACMA’S catalogue focused on highlights from its fine collection of Southeast Asian bronze and metal sculpture. The publication features high-resolution, zoomable images, conservation documentation, videos, maps, and photographs that visually connect the museum’s objects to their place of origin. Select objects can be studied in the round with a user-controlled 360-degree image viewer. An online citation tool makes it easy to reference the catalogue for scholarly purposes, while social media plug-ins allow general sharing on a variety of platforms.

### [The Rauschenberg Research Project](http://www.sfmoma.org/explore/collection/project/rauschenberg_research_project)

SFMOMA’s completed OSCI publication, *The Rauschenberg Research Project*, provides access to the equivalent of 600+ print pages of new research, vibrant illustrations, and multimedia content about the celebrated American artist Robert Rauschenberg. Users can watch video clips of the artist talking about how artworks were created, view annotated images that show how Rauschenberg altered some of his most famous pieces after they were initially exhibited, and read curatorial documents that were previously difficult to access, such as detailed correspondence revealing the artist's secret “recipe” for tinting collaged fabric.

### [Chinese Painting & Caligraphy](http://chinesepainting.seattleartmuseum.org/OSCI/)

Seattle Art Museum (SAM) houses one of the premier collections of Chinese art in North America, but prior to OSCI the material had not been studied in depth and was largely unpublished. SAM’s online catalogue contains a detailed assessment of each object, new photography, in-depth comparative research, and essays from experts. The works’ inscriptions and seals—both of which are of critical historic and artistic significance—were also fully translated, a feature that is rarely available in traditional print catalogues. The zoom function shows images in great detail, and users can also create their own collections of favorite works, as well as add comments in a discussion thread. Since many of these scrolls are not regularly opened and on public view, the online catalogue is provides unprecedented access to these fragile works.

### [The Camden Town Group in Context](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group)

Tate’s OSCI publication is on the British Post-Impressionist circle known as the Camden Town Group, which included artists Spencer Gore, Harold Gilman, and Walter Sickert. In addition to detailed entries for individual works in their collection, Tate’s catalogue includes a wide-ranging selection of research material that elucidates the artists' relationship to their social and cultural context, as well their individual working methods. Highlights include correspondence, sketches, and two other features that would not be possible in print: historical film clips from the period and audio files of popular music hall songs related to depictions by the Camden Town Group artists.

### [Living Collections Catalogue: Volume I](http://www.walkerart.org/collections/publications/performativity)

The Walker’s *Living Collections Catalogue* is a series of thematic publications devoted to the museum’s multidisciplinary collections. The two volumes supported through OSCI are *On Performativity* and *Art Expanded, 1958–1978*. Both editions feature new essays by leading scholars that integrate video, audio, still images, and archival material into a crisp, responsive-design environment that adapts to your viewing device. Essays are versioned and citable with the assurances of a permanent address to the information referenced, while links out to entries in the collections database provide information about individual artworks that is updated dynamically.
